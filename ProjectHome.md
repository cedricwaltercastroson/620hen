This is based on Total\_Noob's 6.20 HEN.

Soon after TN released HEN, many people found it doesn't work well with PSP3000 4g. VFlame released a patch to solve this problem in 6 hours. Meantime, other hackers started reverse engineer of both TN HEN and VFlame patched version.

I set this up as a backup just in case...
(note: HEN itself by jigsaw is license under GPL v2 but xmbctrl is license under GPL v3 coz of the original code by Bubbletune...)
